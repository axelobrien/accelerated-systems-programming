# What is this?

This is a repo containing files for COSC 94 - Accelerated Introduction to
Systems Programming, taught by Ben Kallus at Dartmouth College during the
spring of 2025. It has my submission for all of the assignments as well as the
original syllabus attached. I recieved an A with citation in this course. The
full text of the citation, written by Ben Kallus, officially awarded by Sergey
Bratus, is: "Axel easily picked up the most difficult material in this class,
and consistently excelled during in-class activities."

This is not meant for public eyes. This is a private copy for myself.
